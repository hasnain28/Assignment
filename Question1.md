**VMs**:

In VMs there is a hardware level virtualization.

Each VM runs its own OS.

They are heavyweight.

As a result startup time is in minutes.

Allocates required memory.

VMs are heavyweight.

they are fully isolated and hence more secure.

**Containers:**

OS level virtualization.

Containers are lightweight.

All containers share the host OS.

Start up time in milliseconds.

Requires less memory space.

Process level isolation possibly less secure.
